# ObsidianIris

Iris is a tool for rolling over your previous day's unfinished tasks. This is based on, but not a fork of [this](https://github.com/shichongrui/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos).

### To Install

Download curent release, from the Releases section on the right hand side of the repository. Use folder called Iris.zip. Unzip this and place the output into your .obsidian/plugins folder. Enable Iris in the settings.

[You can also click here to download the latest release.](https://github.com/OliverAndrews/Obsidian-Iris/releases/tag/1.0). Here you should only select Iris.zip, the source files are not needed unless you want to make code changes.

The Javascript is generated from Typescript and I do not suggest editing that, instead alter the main.ts file in the source code for changes.
